# Basic Neural Network implementation in C++

**About:** This program creates basic artificial Neural Networks that can be trained, tested and exported.
  

## How to use:
  To create and train a new Neural Network you must have two files: "topology.nn" & "learningdata.nn"
  You can do that simlpy by executing the **"createfiles.exe"** program!
  
#### How the "topology.nn" file works   



## How it works:
