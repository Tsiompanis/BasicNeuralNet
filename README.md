# Basic Neural Network implementation in C++

**About:** This program creates basic Neural Networks that can be trained, tested and exported.

## How to use:
  To create and train a new Neural Network you must have two files: "topology.nn" & "learningdata.nn"
  You can do that simlpy by executing the "createfiles.exe" program!
  
#### How the "topology.nn" file works   
  ```
  	 The first line represents how many layers you want your Neural net to have (must have at least 3 NOT MORE THAN 500).
     
     The second line has has "amountOfLayers" positive integers that represent how many Neurons each layer has.

		For Example:
		
					3	       In this example we have 3 layers
					3 2 1	   The first layer(input) has 3 Neurons, the second layer(the hidden layer, in this case) has 2 Neurons and                                                                  the last layer(output) has 1 Neuron
  ```
