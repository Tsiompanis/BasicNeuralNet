# Breast cancer Data and Model

There is a [Data set from UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28diagnostic%29) that has a record of ~700 Breast Cancer patients and data about each patients cancer and if the cancer is serious or not.

IMPORTING: THE PROGRAM IMPORTS NEURAL NETWORKS FROM THE FILES: "model.nn" & "topology_model.nn"

In this folder there is a trained model for classifying whether an instance of cancer is serious or not.

After you import the Neural Net you can test it with values in the "testingdata.nn" file.

*(I mapped the dataset between 0 and 1 so it works with my Neural Net)*

  
Accuracy of the model during training:
